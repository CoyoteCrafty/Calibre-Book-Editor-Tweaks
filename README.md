<h2># Calibre-Book-Editor-Tweaks</h2>
<h4>You need <a href="https://calibre-ebook.com/" target="_blank" title="calibre is a powerful and easy to use e-book manager.">Calibre</a> to use these.</h4>
<p>I like to edit ebooks to make them faster to read, and also lighter (sometimes they are really clunky, and can use some streamlining)</p>
<p>First I've written 2 CSS which allow me to make the books easier to read, one for English, the other for French. Both comply with typographic rules of each language.
<p>Then, I've noticed some recurrent mistakes, which I usually correct with the Calibre regex replacement tool. Then I've added some searches to help me put up the css changes rapidly in the html parts of ebooks.</p>
